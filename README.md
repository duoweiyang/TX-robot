# TX-robot
My HTML/CSS interface for Telexistence, a startup in Tokyo in June 2018. Telexistence is a startup in Tokyo that's 
trying to create a human-like robot that can move the same way the user is, even if they're miles apart. I was asked 
to design and create an interface that could easily shut down and restart certain parts of the robot without using 
the terminal.
